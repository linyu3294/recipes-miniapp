**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated From:** v0.0 (2025-01-14)  
**Owner:** Product Manager Agent  
**Status:** Active  

## Executive Summary

The Recipe Recommendation Mini App is a simplified Progressive Web Application that provides recipe recommendations based on available pantry ingredients. This v1.0 revision streamlines the original vision to focus on core user value: helping users discover recipes they can make with ingredients they already have, with minimal complexity and maximum usability.

## Changes from v0.0

### Scope Simplification
- **Removed**: Complex substitution engine with two-tier local+remote LLM system
- **Removed**: "Wildcard" AI recipe generation feature
- **Removed**: Advanced preference learning algorithms
- **Removed**: Web Workers for heavy computations
- **Simplified**: DeepSeek integration limited to context summarization only
- **Simplified**: Storage strategy - single progressive load, no complex chunking
- **Simplified**: UI to two main views: Pantry and Suggestions

### Focus Areas
- **Core Experience**: Fast, intuitive ingredient selection and recipe browsing
- **Data Management**: Simplified IndexedDB using Dexie.js wrapper
- **User Preferences**: Simple like/dislike system for recipes
- **Offline-First**: Maintained but with simpler implementation

## Problem Statement

### Core User Problems
1. **Recipe Discovery**: Users don't know what to cook with available ingredients
2. **Food Waste**: Ingredients expire before being used
3. **Decision Fatigue**: Too many recipe options without clear guidance
4. **Offline Access**: Need recipe access in kitchens without reliable internet

### Market Opportunity
- **124,647 recipes** available for intelligent matching
- **Offline-first** approach differentiates from online-only competitors
- **Simple UX** reduces friction compared to complex recipe apps

## Product Vision

> *"Help home cooks quickly discover recipes they can make with ingredients they already have, through a simple, fast, and reliable app that works anywhere."*
